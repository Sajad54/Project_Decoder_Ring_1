# Project_Decoder_Ring_1

- A program which takes in a message from the user then it uses different methods to encode and decode the message.
- Used Caesar Shift,Polybius Square and Substitution Cypher encoding.
- Decoded as well as encoded messages put into the program.
- Built with: JavaScript, HTML.


This project pushed and tested my ability to be able to write algorithims as well as my ability to write my own tests for this program
using Mochai and Chai.

## Polybius Square
The polybius square will encode text to numbers and decode the numbers. Opening page displays "No message as of yet..."

## Polybius Square Encode
To encode, select the "encode" radio button and simply add a message. The encoded text can be seen below labeled "Output:"

## Polybius Square Decode
Enter the numbers and select the "decode" radio button. The output below will display the decoded message, with (i/j) sharing a number.
